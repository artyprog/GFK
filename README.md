Games for Kids written with [Hexi](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi) and [Transcrypt](http://transcrypt.org/)  

Big Thanks to Jacques de Hooge for Transcrypt and Rex van der Spuy for Hexi

All the games are self contained in one html file, you can 'save link as' and play offine.   
The self contained html file is created with [standalone-html](https://github.com/jgm/standalone-html)

You can even create an 'apk' package for android with [intel-xdk](https://software.intel.com/fr-fr/intel-xdk) or much simpler with [DroidScript](http://droidscript.org/)

List of Games (Use Chrome or Safari to play)    

* [Memory](https://rawgit.com/artyprog/GFK/master/halloffame/memory.html). This game is playable (even on your smartphone), but not yet    finished, missing intro, music, sounds, end and the colors must be better choosen.
